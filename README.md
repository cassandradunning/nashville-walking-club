See and suggest the next walking meet-up in Nashville.

## Application Overview
In July 20222, I started a walking club in Nashville, with the purpose of connecting walkers with a community and exploring new routes. That's how Nashville Walking Club was born.

We meet in a new location at every meet-up and found that we needed a singular place to see upcoming events, and have the ability to submit potential routes for future walks. 

This application is the capstone project for Nashville Software School's client side. We were to use CRUD principles
